# autocomplete-unity

Utilizando o [atom-autocomplete-boilerplate](https://github.com/lonekorean/atom-autocomplete-boilerplate) foi feito esse autocomplete para a API da Unity.  

## Installation

> Atom provides a built-in way to download and install packages, but for local development, you'll want to do it this way.
> 
> 1. Clone this repo.
> 2. Make sure you have apm installed.
>     - On Mac, you might need to start Atom and go to Atom &gt; Install Shell Commands.
>     - On Windows/Ubuntu, it's probably already there.
> 3. Open your terminal, navigate into the repo directory, then run `apm link`.
> 4. Back in Atom, you should now see atom-autocomplete-boilerplate installed.
>     - On Mac, you'll find it under Atom &gt; Preferences... &gt; Packages &gt; Community Packages.
>     - On Windows, you'll find it under File &gt; Settings &gt; Packages &gt; Community Packages.
>     - On Ubuntu, you'll find it under Edit &gt; Preferences &gt; Packages &gt; Community Packages.
> 
> Don't forget to reload Atom when you make changes!
> - On Mac, hit `ctrl` + `option` + `command` + `L`.
> - On Windows/Ubuntu, hit `ctrl` + `shift` + `F5`.
